pocket-ruby
===========

Ruby API for v3 of the [Pocket API](http://getpocket.com/developer/docs/overview) (formerly Read It Later)

This is a fork of [turadg/pocket-ruby](https://github.com/turadg/pocket-ruby) since it hadn't been updated since 2015.

# Usage

Just clone the repo here and refer to the demo-server.rb file for examples on how to interact with the Pocket API.

```sh
	git clone
	cd pocket-ruby-andyw8
	bundle install
	ruby demo-server.rb
```

Pocket-Ruby can be installed via the gem, ```gem install pocket-ruby-andyw8```

Or via bundler, ```gem 'pocket-ruby-andyw8', require: 'pocket-ruby'```
